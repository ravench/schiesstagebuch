"""Does a pull request need the Mac build, and its PR screens?

Reads the changed file paths (one per line) on stdin and prints `mac=true|false` and
`screens=true|false` for $GITHUB_OUTPUT. Pull requests that change only NO_MAC files skip the Mac
job of the Build workflow: lint and the Linux tools job still check them, and runners for macOS
are scarce. Pull requests that change a SCREENS path also get the PR screens in that job.
